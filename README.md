# Unexpected Type Coercion in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) and type coercion.  The `bug.js` file contains code that incorrectly handles null checks due to the implicit type conversion performed by the loose equality operator.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using strict equality (`===`).

## Bug Description

The original code uses loose equality (`==`) to check for null values. This can lead to unexpected behavior because loose equality performs type coercion before comparison.  For example, `0 == false` evaluates to `true`, even though the types are different.  This can cause null checks to fail unexpectedly if a variable holds a value that coerces to `false` but is not strictly equal to `null`.

## Solution

The solution involves replacing loose equality (`==`) with strict equality (`===`). Strict equality checks for both value and type equality, preventing unexpected type coercion and ensuring accurate null checks.
